          large-format print of one of these originals. The second floor is
          dedicated to geometric abstractions, including the interactive work
          <span className='font-bold'>Faucet</span> from the series{' '}
          <span className='font-bold'>Prepared screen</span>, and six new

          serves as a space for discussions and presentations. All works, except
          for the paintings on the second floor, have been tokenized as
